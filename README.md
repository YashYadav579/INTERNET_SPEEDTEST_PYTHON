# 🚀 Internet Speed Test (GUI Version)

### ✅ Project Task - (Python GUI / Networking Utility)

In this task, I developed an Internet Speed Test GUI using Python, Speedtest, and CustomTkinter.
This tool allows users to test their download, upload, and ping speeds with a modern UI, keeping track of test history and offering light/dark mode support.

## 🧠 What is an Internet Speed Test Tool?

An internet speed test measures how fast data is transferred between your device and the internet. It's useful for:
 - 📶 Monitoring internet connection quality
 - 🔍 Diagnosing network slowdowns
 - 💻 Testing download/upload speeds from various servers

## 🎯 Features of This Project

- ✅ One-click speed test (Download / Upload / Ping) 
- 📜 Automatically logs previous 10 test results 
- 🌗 Toggle between Light and Dark modes 
- 🖼️ Custom image display for branding/logo
- 🖥️ Built with modern customtkinter interface
